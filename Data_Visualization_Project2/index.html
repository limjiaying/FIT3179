      <p class="intro">The world population currently stands at <span id="figure">7.98 billion</span>
    , and is estimated to hit <span id="figure">8 billion</span> by end of the year 2022. 
    This total far exceeds the 2015 world population of <span id="figure">7.2 billion</span>. The world's population continues to increase by roughly <span class="blue">140 people per minute</span>, with births outweighing deaths in most countries.</p>

        <h2>World Population Percentage and Population Density</h2>
        <div id="continent"></div>

        <p class="text">The population of <span id="Asia">Asia</span> which is the largest continent with more than 40 countries has took up <span id="bold">more than 50%</span> of the world's population percentage. It is clear that <span id="Asia">India</span> and <span id="Asia">China</span> are the 
            countries that contributes the most to this. While the smallest continent - <span id="Oceania">Oceania</span> with only 4 countries takes up
            <span id="bold">less than 1%</span> of the world population percentage. 
        </p>
          
        
          <p class="text">
            The population density of a country is the number of population per unit of total land area of the country. It can affect
            a country in different ways in terms of economic growth and environmental impact. <span id="bold">High Population Density</span> can cause rapid economic and social development,
            however, on the downside, it may result in overcrowding which can lead to destruction of the country's ecosystem.
            <span id="bold">Low Population Density</span> can allow better nature exposure for the citizens, but may result in political and economic isolation, lack in 
            health care and education, which discourages people from living in an area.

        <div id="growth_rate"></div> 
      <p class="text"> Population growth rate is the annual average rate of change of population size in a country. The world's population continues to increase, with approximately <span class="blue">140 million </span> babies born every year.
        The chart visualizes the top 10 countries with the highest growth rate at 2022. Most populated countries such as China and India are not included, however <span id="Europe">Moldova</span> that is in the <span id="Europe">Europe</span> has
           the highest growth rate in the world ranks at 135 in the world population ranking. This strongly indicates that <span id="bold">country population

          The diverging chart visualizes the changes in the <span id="bold">average population growth in a year</span> for some countries with the largest population <span id="bold">before and after the pandemic</span>. 
          We can observe that the average population growth in most of the country including <span id="Asia">Malaysia</span> and <span id="Oceania">Australia</span> had decreased after the world suffers from COVID19 in the year 2020.
          
        </p>
        <p class="text">The most significant change can be seen in <span id="Asia">China</span>, where it is known to have the strictest lockdown during the pandemic. 
          Countries such as <span id="Asia">Japan</span> and <span id="Europe">Russia</span> that has negative values that implies the decline in population. 
          One main reason that caused this phenomena is the rate of death outweighs the rate of birth due to the COVID19 virus.</p>

          <p class="text">On the other hand, there are countries such as <span id="Africa">Nigeria</span> and <span id="Asia">Pakistan</span>, where their population still continued to <span id="bold">rise</span> even during the pandemic!</p>
